Old readme shown for reference below.
This was my attempt at writing a simple Linux shell.
It kind of works, but I don't recommend using or looking at it at all.
The GPL stuff is kept for reference here, now I am releasing it under
the ISC license, but it is pretty useless that way as it depends
on GNU readline.
==========================================================
# toyshell
Simple Linux shell written in C.

Currently it supports:
- Command history
- Very very very simple scripting
- Relatively good line editing using GNU readline
- Two builtin commands: cd, exit
	
TODO:
- Tab completion
- Pipeing, and redirection
- Improved scripting
- Login shell support
