# projects
This repository is library of my unfinished/no longer used personal projects from the 
last few years. Please keep in my that nothing here is intended to work and is only 
kept as a reference for myself. But if you want to use something from here anyway and 
no other license is specified for that specific project, you can do so under the 
terms specified in `license.txt`.

# note
Most of the projects dumped here were actually developed under source control. So
if you for some reason need the entire source control history of some projects
drop me an e-mail, as I probably still have that archived somewhere.
